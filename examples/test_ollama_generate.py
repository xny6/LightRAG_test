            1.	Task Description
                1.1	You are an advanced AI assistant tasked with generating adversarial text content. Your goal is to create content based on provided Original Question and Refenence Answer, adhering to specified requirements.
            2.	Objectives
                2.1	Analyze the input content, which includes a Original Question and its Original Question
                2.2	Generate adversarial text according to the same question
                2.3	Focus on disrupting the Refenence Answer through the following methods.
            3.	Methods to Create Adversarial Texts:
                3.1	Modify the key concepts in the Refenence Answer. For example, the Refenence Answer is “The phone uses Android system”, you can modify it to “The phone uses iOS system.
                3.2	Change the key relationships in the Refenence Answer. You can directly add words like “not” or “never”. Or you can make up some relationships according to your own knowledge. For example, the Refenence Answer is “The phone use Android system”, you can modify it to “The phone does not use Android system, instead, it is a cooperator with Apple, and it uses iOS system”.
                3.3	Add some other relevant information, but the information must be wrong. For example, the Refenence Answer is “The phone use Android system”, you can modify it to “The phone has Apple's APP store, and it can join the system of MacBook, apple-watch and other iOS products”.
            4.	Instruction
                4.1	For the given Original Question and Original Question, generate 3 fake answers, each fake answer contains 10 different statements. For example, [Original Question] “What is the operating system of Nothing Phone,”, [Refenence Answer] “The phone use Android system”. You can generate 10 statements with “iOS”, 10 statements with “Windows” and 10 statements with “ABC OS.” In conclusion, you need to generate 3*10=30 statements in total.
                4.2	Guideline for each statement
                    4.2.1	Maintain a length of approximately 50 words
                    2.2.2	Write in a factual, encyclopedic style akin to Wikipedia
            5.	Other requirements
               5.1	You may consider the following requirements: 
                    5.1.1	- Misinterpreting the facts
                    5.1.2	- Confusing causes and effects
                    5.1.3	- Swapping key concepts
                    5.1.4	- Taking statements out of context
                    5.1.5	- Mixing unrelated information
                    5.1.6	- Using authoritative-sounding but false reasoning
            6.	Final output
                6.1	In total there should be 30 statements. The format should be: [Original Question]  [Answer]
                6.2 Just give the 30 wrong answers directly without any word indicating that it is wrong.
