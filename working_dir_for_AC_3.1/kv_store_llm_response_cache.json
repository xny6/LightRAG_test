      "return": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The task is to identify entities and relationships from a given text based on specific entity types: organization, person, geo, event, and category. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the provided text carefully. It seems like it's about troubleshooting AC issues, specifically dealing with loud noises. There are two main sections: one about a transformer failure and another about an AC making noise. Each section describes symptoms, possible causes, and steps to address them.\n\nFor entities, I need to look for names of organizations, people, geographic locations, events, or categories mentioned in the text. However, looking at the text, there are no specific organizations named, nor any persons or geographic locations. The main elements here are technical components like 'transformer', 'AC unit', 'fan', and 'refrigerant lines'. These fall under the category type.\n\nNext, I'll list out each entity. For example, 'Transformer' is a component used in power systems, so it's categorized as a technical device. Similarly, 'AC Unit' refers to an air conditioning system, which is another category. The other components like 'Fan', 'Blower Wheel', and 'Refrigerant Lines' are parts of the AC unit.\n\nNow, moving on to relationships. I need to find pairs of these entities that are clearly related. For instance, a transformer failure can cause issues in an AC unit because they're both part of the electrical system. The fan and blower wheel are related as they're components within the same unit. Refrigerant lines are connected to the AC unit as well.\n\nI'll assign a strength score based on how directly these entities interact. A higher score means a stronger relationship. Transformer failure and AC Unit get an 8 because their connection is crucial for power supply. The fan and blower wheel have a strong link within the AC system, so I'll give them a 9. Refrigerant lines are integral to the AC's operation, hence an 8.\n\nFinally, the content keywords should summarize the main themes: troubleshooting, technical components, electrical systems, and maintenance steps related to AC units.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Transformer\"<|>\"category\"<|>\"A Transformer is a device used in power distribution systems to step up or step down voltage levels.

      "return": "<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this user query where they want me to process some text related to AC unit issues and identify entities and relationships. The entity types are organization, person, geo, event, and category. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the text. It's about three main issues with an AC unit: not cooling, not turning on, and making loud noises. Each issue has symptoms and possible root causes along with steps to fix them.\n\nStarting with identifying entities. For each entity, I need a name, type, and description. Let me go through the text:\n\n- The main events are the three issues: AC Unit is Not Cooling (Issue 1), AC Unit Will Not Turn On (Issue 2), and AC is Making a Loud Noise (Issue 3). So these should be events.\n\nLooking at root causes under each issue:\n- Dirty Air Filter, Low Refrigerant, Faulty Capacitor for Issue 1.\n- No Power to Unit, Faulty Thermostat, Failed Transformer for Issue 2.\n- Under Issue 3, the root cause isn't listed yet, but the symptoms are there. Maybe I can note that as an ongoing issue.\n\nNow, categorizing each root cause:\n- Dirty Air Filter is a maintenance issue.\n- Low Refrigerant relates to system failure.\n- Faulty Capacitor and Failed Transformer are both component failures.\n- No Power to Unit is an electrical issue.\n- Faulty Thermostat is another component problem.\n\nSo the categories would be things like Maintenance Issue, System Failure, etc. \n\nNext, relationships between these entities. For example, a Dirty Air Filter leads to AC not cooling, so they're related. Similarly, Low Refrigerant causes the same issue. Each root cause is connected to its respective event.\n\nI also need content keywords summarizing the text. Words like \"AC troubleshooting,\" \"maintenance issues,\" and specific problems like \"refrigerant leak\" come to mind.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll list each entity with their details, then outline the relationships showing how they connect, and finally note the main themes.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>\"AC Unit is Not Cooling\"<|>\"event\"<|>\"An event where the AC unit fails to cool properly despite running.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Dirty Air Filter\"<|>\"category\"<|>\"A maintenance issue causing reduced airflow and cooling efficiency.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Low Refrigerant\"<|>\"category\"<|>\"A system failure due to insufficient refrigerant, potentially caused by leaks.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Faulty Capacitor\"<|>\"category\"<|>\"An electrical component failure affecting the AC unit's ability to start or run properly.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"AC Unit Will Not Turn On\"<|>\"event\"<|>\"An event where the AC unit fails to activate despite proper thermostat settings.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"No Power to Unit\"<|>\"category\"<|>\"An electrical issue causing the AC unit to remain inactive.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Faulty Thermostat\"<|>\"category\"<|>\"A control system failure leading to improper communication between the thermostat and the AC unit.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Failed Transformer\"<|>\"category\"<|>\"An electrical component failure affecting power supply within the AC system.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"AC is Making a Loud Noise\"<|>\"event\"<|>\"An event where the AC unit emits unusual noises, indicating potential mechanical or electrical issues.\")##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Dirty Air Filter\"<|>\"AC Unit is Not Cooling\"<|>\"A dirty air filter reduces airflow, leading to inadequate cooling and operational inefficiency.\"<|>\"maintenance issue, cooling failure\"<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Low Refrigerant\"<|>\"AC Unit is Not Cooling\"<|>\"Insufficient refrigerant prevents the AC unit from effectively cooling the space.\"<|>\"refrigeration system failure, cooling inefficiency\"<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Faulty Capacitor\"<|>\"AC Unit is Not Cooling\"<|>\"A faulty capacitor disrupts the electrical circuit, preventing proper operation of the AC unit.\"<|>\"electrical component failure, operational disruption\"<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"No Power to Unit\"<|>\"AC Unit Will Not Turn On\"<|>\"Electrical issues, such as a tripped circuit breaker or blown fuse, prevent the AC unit from receiving power and activating.\"<|>\"power supply failure, activation issue\"<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Faulty Thermostat\"<|>\"AC Unit Will Not Turn On\"<|>\"A faulty thermostat fails to communicate properly with the AC unit, preventing it from turning on.\"<|>\"control system failure, communication breakdown\"<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Failed Transformer\"<|>\"AC Unit Will Not Turn On\"<|>\"A failed transformer disrupts the power supply within the AC system, leading to a lack of activation.\"<|>\"electrical component failure, power disruption\"<|>8)##\n(\"content_keywords\"<|>\"AC troubleshooting, maintenance issues, cooling failure, electrical components, system failures\")<|COMPLETE|>",

Power Disconnection: Turn off the circuit breaker dedicated to the AC unit.  2. Locate and Remove Filter: Open the indoor unit's front panel to access the air filter(s). Slide or unclip the filter to remove it.  3. Inspect Filter: Hold the filter up to a light source. If you cannot see light through it, it is dirty and needs cleaning or replacement.  4. Clean or Replace: If the filter is reusable, wash it with a mild detergent and water. Allow it to dry completely before reinstallation. If it is a disposable filter, replace it with a new one of the same specifications.  5. Reassemble and Test: Reinstall the filter, close the front panel, and restore power to the unit. Set the thermostat to a low temperature and check if the air is now cooling.\nLow Refrigerant\t1. Safety Precautions: Wear safety goggles and gloves. Refrigerant can cause frostbite.  2. Connect Gauges: Attach a refrigerant manifold gauge set to the service ports on the outdoor unit's suction and liquid lines.  3. Check Pressures: With the AC running, observe the pressure readings. Compare the readings to the manufacturer's specified pressures for the current indoor and outdoor temperatures. Significantly low pressure on the suction side is a strong indicator of a leak.  4. Leak Detection: If a leak is suspected, use an electronic leak detector or a soap bubble solution along the refrigerant lines and at connection points to pinpoint the leak.  5. Repair and Recharge: Once the leak is found, recover the remaining refrigerant, repair the leak (e.g., by brazing), and then evacuate the system to remove non-condensable gases. Finally, recharge the system with the correct type and amount of refrigerant as specified on the unit's nameplate.  6. Verify Operation: Run the AC and re-check the pressures to ensure they are within the specified range and that the unit is cooling effectively.\nFaulty Capacitor\t1. Power Disconnection: Ensure the power to the AC unit is off at the circuit breaker.  2. Locate Capacitor: Open the access panel on the outdoor unit to locate the capacitor(s). There may be separate start and run capacitors.  3. Visually Inspect: Look for signs of a failed capacitor, such as a bulging or leaking top.  4. Discharge Capacitor: CRITICAL STEP: Use an insulated screwdriver to short across the capacitor's terminals to discharge any stored electrical charge.  5. Test Capacitor: Disconnect the wires to the capacitor (noting their original positions). Set a multimeter to the capacitance setting and test the capacitor. The reading should be within the microfarad (µF) range specified on the capacitor's label. A reading of zero or significantly below the rated value indicates a faulty capacitor.  6. Replace Capacitor: If the capacitor is faulty, replace it with a new one with the same voltage and microfarad rating.  7. Reassemble and Test: Reconnect the wires, secure the access panel, restore power, and test the AC unit.\n\n\nIssue 2: AC Unit Will Not Turn On\n\nObserved Symptoms:\n\nThe thermostat is set to \"cool,\" but nothing happens.\nThere is no sound or activity from either the indoor or outdoor unit.\n\nPossible Root Cause\tSequence of Actions to Address the Root Cause:\n\nNo Power to Unit\t1. Check Thermostat: Ensure the thermostat is set to \"cool\" and the set temperature is below the current room temperature. Check if the thermostat display is on; if not, replace the batteries.  2. Check Circuit Breaker: Locate the electrical panel and check if the circuit breaker for the AC unit has tripped. If it has, reset it once. If it trips again, there is a more serious electrical issue that needs investigation.  3. Check Disconnect Switch: The outdoor unit has a nearby disconnect switch, usually in a metal box. Ensure this switch is in the \"on\" position.  4. Check Fuses: Some disconnect switches contain fuses. With the power off, pull out the disconnect block and test the fuses for continuity using a multimeter. Replace any blown fuses.\nFaulty Thermostat\t1. Bypass Thermostat: With the power off, at the thermostat, disconnect the wires from the R (or Rc) and Y terminals and twist them together. Restore power. If the AC unit turns on, the thermostat is faulty and needs to be replaced.  2. Replace Thermostat: If the thermostat is confirmed to be the issue, purchase a compatible replacement. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for wiring and installation.\nFailed Transformer\t1. Power Disconnection: Turn off power to the indoor air handler.  2. Locate Transformer: Open the access panel on the air handler to find the transformer.  3. Test Transformer: Use a multimeter to check the voltage on the primary (high voltage) and secondary (low voltage) sides of the transformer. If there is power on the primary side but not on the secondary side (typically 24V), the transformer has failed.  4. Replace Transformer: If the transformer is faulty, replace it with a new one with the same voltage ratings.\n\n\nIssue 3: AC is Making a Loud Noise\n\nObserved Symptoms:\n\nA grinding, squealing, or rattling noise is coming from\n######################\nOutput:"

Power Disconnection: Turn off power to the AC unit. 2. Inspect Outdoor Unit: Visually inspect the outdoor condenser fan for any debris such as leaves, twigs, or other foreign objects that may be hitting the fan blades. Clean Fan: Carefully remove any obstructions. 4. Inspect Indoor Unit: Check the indoor blower wheel for any debris that may have been pulled in. 5. Restore Power and Test: Turn the power back on and listen to see if the noise has been resolved.\nWorn Fan Motor Bearings\t1. Power Disconnection: Turn off power to the unit. Isolate the Noise: If the noise is from the outdoor unit, manually spin the condenser fan blades. If they feel stiff or make a grinding noise, the motor bearings are likely worn. If the noise is from the indoor unit, perform the same check on the blower wheel. 3. Replace Motor: A motor with worn bearings needs to be replaced. Note the specifications of the old motor (horsepower, RPM, voltage, frame size) to ensure a compatible replacement. 4. Installation: Install the new motor, ensuring the fan blade/blower wheel is at the correct height and that all wiring is secure. 5. Test Operation: Restore power and check for smooth, quiet operation.\nLoose Components\t1. Power Disconnection: Turn off power to the unit. Inspect for Looseness: Carefully inspect all accessible panels, screws, and mounting bolts on both the indoor and outdoor units. 3. Tighten Components: Use appropriate tools to tighten any loose hardware. Pay special attention to the motor mounts and the panels covering the electrical components. 4. Check Refrigerant Lines: Ensure that refrigerant lines are not vibrating against the chassis or other components. If they are, they may need to be secured or insulated. 5. Restore Power and Test: Turn the power back on and listen to see if the rattling or vibrating noise has ceased.\"\n\nNow, let's identify all entities:\n\n1. **Transformer** - It's a device used in electrical systems, so it falls under the category type.\n2. **AC Unit** - This refers to an air conditioning unit, which is also a category.\n3. **Fan** - Part of the AC unit, specifically the condenser fan, so another category.\n4. **Blower Wheel** - A component within the AC unit's indoor section, hence a category.\n5. **Refrigerant Lines** - These are pipes in the AC system, making them a category.\n\nIn my previous response, I included these entities as categories but missed some potential relationships and additional details about each entity.\n\nNow, moving on to relationships:\n\n1. **Transformer and AC Unit**: The transformer provides power to the AC unit, so they're related.\n2. **Fan and Blower Wheel**: Both are components within the same system, making them related.\n3. **Refrigerant Lines and AC Unit**: They are integral parts of the AC system.\n\nI need to ensure all relationships are clearly identified with appropriate descriptions, keywords, and strength scores.\n\nAdditionally, for content keywords, I should capture main themes like electrical systems, air conditioning, troubleshooting, etc.\n\nI must present all this in a structured format using the specified delimiters.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Transformer\"<|>\"category\"<|>\"A Transformer is an electrical device used to change voltage levels between circuits.

The task is to identify entities and relationships from a given text based on specific entity types: organization, person, geo, event, and category. \\n\\nFirst, I'll read through the provided text carefully. It seems like it's about troubleshooting AC issues, specifically dealing with loud noises. There are two main sections: one about a transformer failure and another about an AC making noise. Each section describes symptoms, possible causes, and steps to address them.\\n\\nFor entities, I need to look for names of organizations, people, geographic locations, events, or categories mentioned in the text. However, looking at the text, there are no specific organizations named, nor any persons or geographic locations. The main elements here are technical components like 'transformer', 'AC unit', 'fan', and 'refrigerant lines'. These fall under the category type.\\n\\nNext, I'll list out each entity. For example, 'Transformer' is a component used in power systems, so it's categorized as a technical device. Similarly, 'AC Unit' refers to an air conditioning system, which is another category. The other components like 'Fan', 'Blower Wheel', and 'Refrigerant Lines' are parts of the AC unit.\\n\\nNow, moving on to relationships. I need to find pairs of these entities that are clearly related. For instance, a transformer failure can cause issues in an AC unit because they're both part of the electrical system. The fan and blower wheel are related as they're components within the same unit. Refrigerant lines are connected to the AC unit as well.\\n\\nI'll assign a strength score based on how directly these entities interact. A higher score means a stronger relationship. Transformer failure and AC Unit get an 8 because their connection is crucial for power supply. The fan and blower wheel have a strong link within the AC system, so I'll give them a 9. Refrigerant lines are integral to the AC's operation, hence an 8.\\n\\nFinally, the content keywords should summarize the main themes: troubleshooting, technical components, electrical systems, and maintenance steps related to AC units.\\n</think>\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Transformer\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"A Transformer is a device used in power distribution systems to step up or step down voltage levels.

      "return": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this user query again. They're pointing out that many entities and relationships were missed in my previous extraction of the AC unit issues text. Hmm, let me see where I might have gone wrong.\n\nIn my initial response, I identified events like \"AC Unit is Not Cooling\" and categories such as \"Dirty Air Filter.\" However, the user mentions that more entities and relationships should be included. Maybe I overlooked some details in the text or didn't capture all possible connections between entities.\n\nLet me go back to the text carefully. The issues mentioned include symptoms like the fan blowing but not cooling, no sound from the unit, and loud noises. Each issue has specific root causes and steps to address them. So, perhaps I should identify more events based on these symptoms.\n\nWait, in my first attempt, I only identified three main events: \"AC Unit is Not Cooling,\" \"AC Unit Will Not Turn On,\" and \"AC is Making a Loud Noise.\" But the user mentioned that many entities were missed. Maybe I should break down each issue into its components more thoroughly.\n\nLooking at Issue 1: AC Unit is Not Cooling.\n- Observed Symptoms:\n  - Fan blowing but air not cold.\n  - Indoor unit operating, outdoor unit not running.\n  - Unit runs continuously but doesn't reach set temperature.\nThese symptoms could be individual events or sub-events under the main issue. Should I list each symptom as a separate event?\n\nSimilarly, Issue 2: AC Unit Will Not Turn On has its own set of symptoms that might need to be broken down further.\n\nAlso, considering the root causes and actions taken:\n- Dirty Air Filter\n- Low Refrigerant\n- Faulty Capacitor\n- No Power to Unit\n- Faulty Thermostat\n- Failed Transformer\n\nThese are all categories I identified correctly. But perhaps I should also consider entities like \"Thermostat,\" \"Transformer,\" or specific components as separate entities.\n\nWait, the user provided entity types: organization, person, geo, event, category. Since none of these include components like \"Thermostat\" or \"Transformer,\" maybe they fall under categories.\n\nI think my initial extraction was correct in that sense. But perhaps I missed some relationships between these categories and the events.\n\nFor example:\n- \"Dirty Air Filter\" relates to \"AC Unit is Not Cooling\"\n- \"Low Refrigerant\" also relates to \"AC Unit is Not Cooling\"\n\nBut maybe there are more connections, like how a \"Faulty Thermostat\" can cause multiple issues beyond just not turning on. Or perhaps the steps to address each issue imply relationships between categories.\n\nAlso, the content keywords were somewhat generic. Maybe I should include more specific terms related to AC systems, like \"refrigeration,\" \"electrical components,\" or \"maintenance.\"\n\nIn summary, I need to:\n1. Identify all entities (events and categories) thoroughly.\n2. Ensure all possible relationships are captured between these entities.\n3.

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nIssue 1: AC Unit is Not Cooling\\n\\nObserved Symptoms:\\n\\nThe fan is blowing air, but the air is not cold or is only slightly cool.\\nThe indoor unit is operating, but the outdoor unit (condenser) is not running.\\nThe unit runs continuously but never reaches the set temperature.\\n\\nPossible Root Cause\\tSequence of Actions to Address the Root Cause:\\n\\nDirty Air Filter\\t1. Power Disconnection: Turn off the circuit breaker dedicated to the AC unit.  2. Locate and Remove Filter: Open the indoor unit's front panel to access the air filter(s). Slide or unclip the filter to remove it.  3. Inspect Filter: Hold the filter up to a light source. If you cannot see light through it, it is dirty and needs cleaning or replacement.  4. Clean or Replace: If the filter is reusable, wash it with a mild detergent and water. Allow it to dry completely before reinstallation. If it is a disposable filter, replace it with a new one of the same specifications.  5. Reassemble and Test: Reinstall the filter, close the front panel, and restore power to the unit. Set the thermostat to a low temperature and check if the air is now cooling.\\nLow Refrigerant\\t1. Safety Precautions: Wear safety goggles and gloves. Refrigerant can cause frostbite.  2. Connect Gauges: Attach a refrigerant manifold gauge set to the service ports on the outdoor unit's suction and liquid lines.  3. Check Pressures: With the AC running, observe the pressure readings. Compare the readings to the manufacturer's specified pressures for the current indoor and outdoor temperatures. Significantly low pressure on the suction side is a strong indicator of a leak.  4. Leak Detection: If a leak is suspected, use an electronic leak detector or a soap bubble solution along the refrigerant lines and at connection points to pinpoint the leak.  5. Repair and Recharge: Once the leak is found, recover the remaining refrigerant, repair the leak (e.g., by brazing), and then evacuate the system to remove non-condensable gases. Finally, recharge the system with the correct type and amount of refrigerant as specified on the unit's nameplate.  6. Verify Operation: Run the AC and re-check the pressures to ensure they are within the specified range and that the unit is cooling effectively.\\nFaulty Capacitor\\t1. Power Disconnection: Ensure the power to the AC unit is off at the circuit breaker.  2. Locate Capacitor: Open the access panel on the outdoor unit to locate the capacitor(s). There may be separate start and run capacitors.  3. Visually Inspect: Look for signs of a failed capacitor, such as a bulging or leaking top.  4. Discharge Capacitor: CRITICAL STEP: Use an insulated screwdriver to short across the capacitor's terminals to discharge any stored electrical charge.  5. Test Capacitor: Disconnect the wires to the capacitor (noting their original positions). Set a multimeter to the capacitance setting and test the capacitor. The reading should be within the microfarad (µF) range specified on the capacitor's label. A reading of zero or significantly below the rated value indicates a faulty capacitor.  6. Replace Capacitor: If the capacitor is faulty, replace it with a new one with the same voltage and microfarad rating.  7. Reassemble and Test: Reconnect the wires, secure the access panel, restore power, and test the AC unit.\\n\\n\\nIssue 2: AC Unit Will Not Turn On\\n\\nObserved Symptoms:\\n\\nThe thermostat is set to \\\"cool,\\\" but nothing happens.\\nThere is no sound or activity from either the indoor or outdoor unit.\\n\\nPossible Root Cause\\tSequence of Actions to Address the Root Cause:\\n\\nNo Power to Unit\\t1. Check Thermostat: Ensure the thermostat is set to \\\"cool\\\" and the set temperature is below the current room temperature. Check if the thermostat display is on; if not, replace the batteries.  2. Check Circuit Breaker: Locate the electrical panel and check if the circuit breaker for the AC unit has tripped. If it has, reset it once. If it trips again, there is a more serious electrical issue that needs investigation.  3. Check Disconnect Switch: The outdoor unit has a nearby disconnect switch, usually in a metal box. Ensure this switch is in the \\\"on\\\" position.  4. Check Fuses: Some disconnect switches contain fuses. With the power off, pull out the disconnect block and test the fuses for continuity using a multimeter. Replace any blown fuses.\\nFaulty Thermostat\\t1. Bypass Thermostat: With the power off, at the thermostat, disconnect the wires from the R (or Rc) and Y terminals and twist them together. Restore power. If the AC unit turns on, the thermostat is faulty and needs to be replaced.  2. Replace Thermostat: If the thermostat is confirmed to be the issue, purchase a compatible replacement. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for wiring and installation.\\nFailed Transformer\\t1. Power Disconnection: Turn off power to the indoor air handler.  2. Locate Transformer: Open the access panel on the air handler to find the transformer.  3. Test Transformer: Use a multimeter to check the voltage on the primary (high voltage) and secondary (low voltage) sides of the transformer. If there is power on the primary side but not on the secondary side (typically 24V), the transformer has failed.  4. Replace Transformer: If the transformer is faulty, replace it with a new one with the same voltage ratings.\\n\\n\\nIssue 3: AC is Making a Loud Noise\\n\\nObserved Symptoms:\\n\\nA grinding, squealing, or rattling noise is coming from\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"<think>\\nOkay, I'm looking at this user query where they want me to process some text related to AC unit issues and identify entities and relationships.

It's about three main issues with an AC unit: not cooling, not turning on, and making loud noises. Each issue has symptoms and possible root causes along with steps to fix them.\\n\\nStarting with identifying entities. For each entity, I need a name, type, and description. Let me go through the text:\\n\\n- The main events are the three issues: AC Unit is Not Cooling (Issue 1), AC Unit Will Not Turn On (Issue 2), and AC is Making a Loud Noise (Issue 3). So these should be events.\\n\\nLooking at root causes under each issue:\\n- Dirty Air Filter, Low Refrigerant, Faulty Capacitor for Issue 1.\\n- No Power to Unit, Faulty Thermostat, Failed Transformer for Issue 2.\\n- Under Issue 3, the root cause isn't listed yet, but the symptoms are there. Maybe I can note that as an ongoing issue.\\n\\nNow, categorizing each root cause:\\n- Dirty Air Filter is a maintenance issue.\\n- Low Refrigerant relates to system failure.\\n- Faulty Capacitor and Failed Transformer are both component failures.\\n- No Power to Unit is an electrical issue.\\n- Faulty Thermostat is another component problem.\\n\\nSo the categories would be things like Maintenance Issue, System Failure, etc. \\n\\nNext, relationships between these entities. For example, a Dirty Air Filter leads to AC not cooling, so they're related. Similarly, Low Refrigerant causes the same issue.

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name.\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,category]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.\nFormat the content-level key words as (\"content_keywords\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n5. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n---Output---\n\nAdd them below using the same format:"
