What can I do?\tIf the phone won't turn off by when you press the power button and volume up key simutaniously, try the following:\n\n1. Check if the button is faulty.\n2. Check if the phone has crash dump or freeze issue. Press and hold the power button for more than 12 seconds to force the phone to restart.\n4. Uninstall and remove any recently downloaded apps.\n5. Back up your data and restore your phone to factory settings.\n\nIf the issue persists, please contact our Customer Support for further assistance.\nMy phone is unresponsive when charging. What can I do?\tYou can charge your phone by:\n1. Using the charger: please use the Nothing cable and charger to connect the phone to a power outlet for charging.\n2. Using the USB port: connect the phone to the computer or other device via a USB cable.\n\nEnsure you know what the battery and charging icons mean so you can tell the current battery status by the battery icon on the status bar and the lightning bolt icon next to the battery.\nNote: After the battery percentage is turned on, the battery icon will display it (Settings > Battery > Battery percentage).\n\nIf your phone fails to be charged properly when connected, try to:\n1. Disconnect the charging adapter and charging cable again.\n2. Restart and then charge it.\n3. Monitor the temperature of your device. Charging will stop when the temperature is higher than 47°C to protect your device.\n\nIf the issue persists, contact our Customer Support for further assistance.\nMy phone is heating up. What can I do?\tPhone use environment\nPhones are generally suitable for use in an environment with a temperature between 0 and 35°C. Temperatures higher or lower than that can affect the operation of the phone, causing overheating and charging issues. In severe cases, they may cause damage to the phone and battery.\n\nAdvice:\n- Don't use your phone for a long time in a high-temperature environment, especially in summer. When the outdoor temperature is high, the phone is prone to heating.\n- When the phone is charging or the temperature rises, take off the case and leave the phone for some time with the screen off. Choose thin and breathable phone cases rather than heavy ones (leather or metal cases).\n- Choose a qualified phone radiator with good heat dissipation and cooling performance, or use a wet tissue to put on the back of the mobile phone to help dissipate heat.\n\nHeating usage scenario:\n1. High-power consumption scenarios\na) The signal is weak\nWhen the WiFi signal and SIM signal are weak, the device will increase the power of transmitting and receiving signals (currently, 5G base station coverage is incomplete, and the network signal is poor in some areas, resulting in increased power consumption and heat generation of mobile phones when using 5G).\nb) Play games\nTo ensure game image quality and smoothness, phone CPU, GPU and other chips need to operate at high performance. The network needs to communicate with the game server in real time. In addition, the screen and speakers work at the same time. The device is running with a high load, and the temperature of the phone will rise accordingly (generally reaches maximum temperature after 20 minutes).\nc) Watch videos\nThe phone screen, data processor and image processor are in a long-term working state. For example, when playing videos or live broadcasts, high-resolution and streaming comments will increase power consumption and generate more heat.\nd) Many backgrounds\nIf there are too many apps running in the background, or if the phone has WiFi, GPS, NFC, Bluetooth and other functions searching for signals or networks in the background, it will easily become overheated.\n\n2. When charging your mobile phone:\nCharging is an energy conversion process. The charging equipment generates a certain amount of heat during operation, causing both the phone and the charger to heat up. This is normal. Phones that support fast charging generate more heat during charging.\n\nSuggestion:\na) Be sure to use the official charger. Don't place the phone in a high-temperature environment with poor heat dissipation when charging.\nb) Avoid playing with your phone while charging. If the phone continues to run during charging, it will increase the load on the phone's CPU and increase heat.\n\nNote:\n- The phone needs hardware to cooperate during operation. When working, it will inevitably generate heat.\n- If the phone heats up inexplicably, turn it off for some time and restart it. If the issue persists, contact our Customer Service or go to the repair center designated by Nothing for testing with your purchase invoice, warranty card and phone.\nThe battery has dropped quickly. What can I do? Plus, how do I check my phone's power consumption?\tPlease try the below:\n\n1. Fast power consumption in a low-temperature environment:\nLithium batteries deteriorate in low-temperature environments, resulting in increased power consumption, which is normal. When the temperature returns to normal, the power consumption normalises, too.\n2. Fast power consumption with 5G network:\nWhen the phone uses the 5G network, the 4G network will be turned on simultaneously, so the power consumption will increase, too. You can turn it on or off as you need. (Path: Settings > Network & internet > SIMs > Preferred network type.\n3. Fast power consumption after a system update:\nDue to system integration and optimisation, power consumption increases after a system update.

After detection, the earphones will automatically generate corresponding noise reduction parameters to optimize the current noise cancellation effect, providing the best noise cancellation experience for the user. This entire process runs automatically without user intervention.\n\nThe algorithm operates under specific conditions; if the conditions are not met, the algorithm will not be triggered and will default to running with fixed strong noise reduction parameters. This ensures that the basic noise cancellation experience remains unaffected, so you can use it with confidence.\n\nFor the algorithm to function correctly, please ensure the following conditions are met during wear:\n1. The default noise cancellation state after wearing needs to be ANC ON: You can switch to ANC ON state through the app or pressure-sensitive controls after wearing, then remove and re-wear the earphones to trigger the in-ear detection and the Smart ANC algorithm.\n2. To achieve noticeable noise cancellation improvement, ensure the ambient noise level is >65dB when triggering the detection.\n3. Avoid swallowing movements during the detection process.\n\nIf you notice a difference in noise cancellation, you can remove and re-wear the earphones under the above conditions to trigger the algorithm detection.\nCan the charging case still charge the earbuds when it is low on battery?\tYes, the charging case can still charge the earbuds when the battery is below 30% but above 1%.

It is calculated from your heart's response to exercise over a rolling 7-day period. This metric helps you gauge the intensity and effectiveness of your workouts. Aim for an Active Score of 100 each week to maintain good health.\n\nImportantly, any amount of physical activity is better than none. Incremental increases in physical activity, even at low intensities, can contribute to health improvements by reducing sedentary time.\n\nHow Is It Calculated? \nThe Active Score is tailored to individual profiles, including factors like age, resting heart rate, maximum heart rate, and recent exercise history over the last 7 days.\nBy performing physical activities while monitored by your smartwatch,", "full_doc_id": "doc-ad11bd24c2ae4c22b992d14233757ea5", "file_path": "unknown_source"}, {"__id__": "chunk-590cdcbe56adc5d18b9c251fc5625235", "__created_at__": 1749106349, "content": "an Active Score of 100 each week to maintain good health.\n\nImportantly, any amount of physical activity is better than none. Incremental increases in physical activity, even at low intensities, can contribute to health improvements by reducing sedentary time.\n\nHow Is It Calculated? \nThe Active Score is tailored to individual profiles, including factors like age, resting heart rate, maximum heart rate, and recent exercise history over the last 7 days.\nBy performing physical activities while monitored by your smartwatch, you accumulate Active scores. Activities of higher intensity will generate more scores in less time, enhancing your score more efficiently.\nAs your Active Score grows, acquiring additional points becomes progressively challenging.\n\nWhy Is It Calculated On A 7-Day Basis? \nThe Active Score offers a snapshot of your physical activity impact over a rolling 7-day period. This flexible system allows you to spread your activity throughout the week without the pressure of achieving a high level of exercise every single day. Accumulating scores is possible anytime within this period, although we recommend engaging in physical activities 2-3 times a week to optimize both your physical and mental well-being.\nWhat is Training Load?\tTraining Load is an estimate of the physical stress exerted on your body during and after a workout, based on parameters such as training time, distance, and intensity. This metric directly relates to your body's fatigue level. \n\nAfter each workout, the Training Load can be calculated using the duration and heart rate of the exercise. By tracking the daily Training Load over seven days, you can observe fluctuations in your weekly Training Load curve.\n\nFollowing a workout, physical fitness initially decreases but gradually increases with proper diet and sleep, often surpassing the original fitness level—a phenomenon known as supercompensation. To improve fitness, it's crucial to balance training and rest; continuous overloading can lead to suboptimal results.\n\nAerobic Training Effect (ATE) Ratings:\n<1.0: Light activity or warm-up\n1.0-1.9: Relaxed state (low intensity, helps in relaxation and recovery)\n2.0-2.9: Basic training (maintains basic aerobic fitness)\n3.0-3.9: Effective training (gradually enhances fitness)\n4.0-4.9: Intensive training (promotes significant fitness improvement)\n5.0: Extreme challenge (high-risk, requires full recovery)\n\nAnaerobic Training Effect (AnTE) Ratings:\n<1.0: Light activity or warm-up\n1.0-1.9: Light activation (awakens muscles with light intensity)\n2.0-2.9: Maintenance level (maintains current muscle status)\n3.0-3.9: Moderate improvement (enhances muscle strength)\n4.0-4.9: Significant enhancement (promotes substantial fitness improvement)\n5.0: Extreme challenge (high-risk, requires full recovery)\nWhat is Recovery Time?\tRecovery Time indicates the duration required for you to fully recover your fitness before engaging in the next intense workout.\nThe recovery time is displayed immediately after each exercise session and counts down to help you evaluate when you are ready for high-intensity training again. This feature aids in planning your training schedule effectively. If you work out before fully recovering, the recovery time will accumulate.\nWhat is WorkOut Detection?\t1.

It supports 24 bit/192 kHz high-resolution audio streaming transmission. The transmission rate can reach up to 1 Mbps, which is about 4 times that of the traditional SBC encoder (328Kbps). The high-resolution audio file will not be over-compressed, so more music details can be retained, and the sound quality will be significantly improved.\n*High-quality audio settings need to be supported by the phone and the selected codec must be enabled on the phone to take effect.\n\nFor Nothing phones, the LHDC Bluetooth audio codec function is turned on by default. After the user connects the headset using Nothing OS, LHDC high-quality Bluetooth audio transmission is enabled by default. Users can operate the headset in the Nothing X app to turn on or off LHDC audio encoding.\nFor non-Nothing Android phones, you can check whether the phone supports LHDC in the Bluetooth Audio Codec settings of the phone. If the phone supports it, turn on the phone's LHDC in the settings and confirm that LHDC is checked in the HD encoding options of the Nothing X app. LHDC high-quality Bluetooth audio transmission will be turned on.\n*To ensure smooth playback of LHDC high-definition audio, it is recommended to turn off the Dual Connection function when using this function to ensure sufficient bandwidth for the LHDC high-definition stream.\n*Since iOS devices only support the AAC Bluetooth codec, other high-quality audio codecs are not currently supported.\nHow to use the LDAC feature?\tLDAC high-definition audio can be likened to a \"highway\" between the phone and headphones, supporting streaming rates of 990kbps and a sample rate of 96kHz with a bit depth of 24-bit. The high transmission bit rate allows high-resolution audio files to be less compressed, retaining more music details and noticeably improving sound quality.\n*This high-definition audio requires support from the phone and the selected codec needs to be activated on the device to take effect.\n\nFor Android phones, first check if LDAC is enabled by default on your phone. If not, go to [Settings – Developer Options] to see if LDAC is supported. If your phone supports it, activate the phone's LDAC and make sure high-definition encoding is turned on in the Nothing X app, thus enabling LDAC high-definition audio encodinг.\n*To ensure smooth playback of LDAC high-definition audio, it is recommended that when using this feature, 1) the default LDAC playback quality in the developer options is set to adaptive; 2) if the phone chooses a higher quality audio stream, it is advised to turn off dual connection functionality to ensure there is enough bandwidth for the LDAC high-definition stream.\n*Since iOS devices only support the AAC Bluetooth high-quality audio codec, for the time being, they cannot support other high-quality audio codecs.\nHow do I set up a Personal Sound Profile?\t1.
