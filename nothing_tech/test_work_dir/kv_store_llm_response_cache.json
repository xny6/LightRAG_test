Both low and high temperatures can slow down the charging process. Depending on the protocol, each charger has different charging speed and full charging time. For an optimal charge, we recommend that you:\n1) Use a PPS protocol charger.\n2) Charge the phone at room temperature (e.g.: 25°C ±3°C) with the screen turned off.\n\n------------------------------\nRecord 20:\nQuestions: How long does it take to fully charge the Phone?\nAnwsers: The charging time of the Phone depends on temperature and the charger used:\n\nTemperature: Both low and high temperatures can slow down the charging speed. For optimal results, charge at room temperature (about 25°C ± 3°C) with the screen turned off.\nCharger Protocol: Different charger protocols offer varying charging speeds.\nTo achieve a full charge in approximately 1 hour, use a PPS protocol charger, ideally the official Nothing charger.\n\n------------------------------\nRecord 21:\nQuestions: Do I need to restart my phone every day?\nAnwsers: No, you don't need to restart Nothing Phone every day.\n\n------------------------------\nRecord 22:\nQuestions: What is WiFi Direct?\nAnwsers: WiFi Direct allows devices to connect and share files directly through WiFi at a range and speed beyond the capabilities of Bluetooth. Common uses of WiFi Direct: 1. Fast file sharing: WiFi Direct is an excellent way to quickly share large files with friends or groups when you can't connect to a wired connection. 2. Screen-casting and screen-sharing: share family photos on your TV or digital portrait, etc. For Nothing Phone, WiFi Direct is key for nearby sharing, screen-casting, etc. It can't handle the file transfer or screencast independently.\n\n------------------------------\nRecord 23:\nQuestions: What is the USB tethering feature and how do I use it?\nAnwsers: USB Tethering means internet sharing. It makes your phone a WiFi router and allows you to share your phone's internet connection with the connected PC. Tethering works when your phone is connected to the internet via mobile data or a WiFi network. 1. Go to Settings > Network & internet > Hotspot & tethering > USB tethering. 2. Connect Nothing Phone to the computer with the USB cable. 3. Connect to WiFi with network access or insert the SIM card to Nothing Phone and connect to an available data network.\n\n------------------------------\nRecord 24:\nQuestions: Is it harmful to not shut down my Phone for an extended period?\nAnwsers: By not shutting down for a long time, Nothing Phone will slow down. This is because junk files are generated whenever the phone is in operation, and over time, this can clog the system.\n\n------------------------------\nRecord 25:\nQuestions: Is there a 3.5mm headphone jack on Nothing Phone?\nAnwsers: No, there is no 3.5mm headphone jack on Nothing Phone.\n\n------------------------------\nRecord 26:\nQuestions: Does Nothing Phone support WiFi 6?\nAnwsers: Yes, it does.\n\n------------------------------\nRecord 27:\nQuestions: Is there expandable memory/storage on Nothing Phone?\nAnwsers: No, Nothing Phone does not support expandable storage.\n\n------------------------------\nRecord 28:\nQuestions: Will the Phone support dual SIM?\nAnwsers: Yes, it supports dual SIM\n\n------------------------------\nRecord 29:\nQuestions: Does the Phone support face unlock?\nAnwsers: Yes, Nothing Phone supports face unlock.\n\n------------------------------\nRecord 30:\nQuestions: Does the Phone support fingerprint unlock?\nAnwsers: Yes,Nothing Phone supports fingerprint unlock.\n\n------------------------------\nRecord 31:\nQuestions: What's a system update?\nAnwsers: For the best possible experience, we release new system updates from time to time. Upgrading software to the latest version fixes software issues. In some cases, new features are added to optimise performance further. Please always update to the latest software version. To find the latest updates, go to Settings System System update.\n\n------------------------------\nRecord 32:\nQuestions: How often should I shut down and restart my phone?\nAnwsers: We recommend you manually restart your phone once a week. This helps the phone self-repair.\n\n------------------------------\nRecord 33:\nQuestions: How does dual SIM work?\nAnwsers: #NAME?\n\n------------------------------\nRecord 34:\nQuestions: What causes network connection failures during a call?\nAnwsers: 1. Ensure you're not in a congested network area. 2. Try calling a different contact to see if the problem still occurs. 3. Try a different SIM card. 4. Go to Settings->Network & internet->SIMs and enable Automatic  data switching\n\n------------------------------\nRecord 35:\nQuestions: What is OTG connection?\nAnwsers: USB OTG (USB On The Go) is a standard that enables mobile devices to talk to one another. Traditionally mobile devices could only connect to a Mac / PC by USB, but USB OTG makes it possible for devices to connect directly to each other. USB OTG can help you read the data from the U disk, charge the phone at a low current, etc.\n\n------------------------------\nRecord 36:\nQuestions: What is the status bar?\nAnwsers: The status bar is at the top of the phone display screen, where you can see different icons: time, battery percentage, etc. Swipe down once from the very top of the screen to access quick access. Swipe down twice for the control centre. It will give you instant access to the data network, WiFi, airplane mode, hotspot, Bluetooth, etc.\n\n------------------------------\nRecord 37:\nQuestions: Will my phone lose data when getting repaired?\nAnwsers: We recommend you back up important data before sending your phone to the service\n######################\nOutput:"

Tethering works when your phone is connected to the internet via mobile data or a WiFi network. 1. Go to Settings > Network & internet > Hotspot & tethering > USB tethering. 2. Connect Nothing Phone to the computer with the USB cable. 3. Connect to WiFi with network access or insert the SIM card to Nothing Phone and connect to an available data network.\\n\\n------------------------------\\nRecord 24:\\nQuestions: Is it harmful to not shut down my Phone for an extended period?\\nAnwsers: By not shutting down for a long time, Nothing Phone will slow down. This is because junk files are generated whenever the phone is in operation, and over time, this can clog the system.\\n\\n------------------------------\\nRecord 25:\\nQuestions: Is there a 3.5mm headphone jack on Nothing Phone?\\nAnwsers: No, there is no 3.5mm headphone jack on Nothing Phone.\\n\\n------------------------------\\nRecord 26:\\nQuestions: Does Nothing Phone support WiFi 6?\\nAnwsers: Yes, it does.\\n\\n------------------------------\\nRecord 27:\\nQuestions: Is there expandable memory/storage on Nothing Phone?\\nAnwsers: No, Nothing Phone does not support expandable storage.\\n\\n------------------------------\\nRecord 28:\\nQuestions: Will the Phone support dual SIM?\\nAnwsers: Yes, it supports dual SIM\\n\\n------------------------------\\nRecord 29:\\nQuestions: Does the Phone support face unlock?\\nAnwsers: Yes, Nothing Phone supports face unlock.\\n\\n------------------------------\\nRecord 30:\\nQuestions: Does the Phone support fingerprint unlock?\\nAnwsers: Yes,Nothing Phone supports fingerprint unlock.\\n\\n------------------------------\\nRecord 31:\\nQuestions: What's a system update?\\nAnwsers: For the best possible experience, we release new system updates from time to time. Upgrading software to the latest version fixes software issues. In some cases, new features are added to optimise performance further. Please always update to the latest software version. To find the latest updates, go to Settings System System update.\\n\\n------------------------------\\nRecord 32:\\nQuestions: How often should I shut down and restart my phone?\\nAnwsers: We recommend you manually restart your phone once a week. This helps the phone self-repair.\\n\\n------------------------------\\nRecord 33:\\nQuestions: How does dual SIM work?\\nAnwsers: #NAME?\\n\\n------------------------------\\nRecord 34:\\nQuestions: What causes network connection failures during a call?\\nAnwsers: 1. Ensure you're not in a congested network area. 2. Try calling a different contact to see if the problem still occurs. 3. Try a different SIM card. 4. Go to Settings->Network & internet->SIMs and enable Automatic  data switching\\n\\n------------------------------\\nRecord 35:\\nQuestions: What is OTG connection?\\nAnwsers: USB OTG (USB On The Go) is a standard that enables mobile devices to talk to one another. Traditionally mobile devices could only connect to a Mac / PC by USB, but USB OTG makes it possible for devices to connect directly to each other. USB OTG can help you read the data from the U disk, charge the phone at a low current, etc.\\n\\n------------------------------\\nRecord 36:\\nQuestions: What is the status bar?\\nAnwsers: The status bar is at the top of the phone display screen, where you can see different icons: time, battery percentage, etc. Swipe down once from the very top of the screen to access quick access.
