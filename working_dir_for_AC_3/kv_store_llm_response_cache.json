      "return": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to analyze a given text document and identify entities of specific types (organization, person, geo, event, category) along with their relationships. Then, I also need to extract content-level keywords.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the provided text carefully. It's about troubleshooting AC issues, specifically dealing with loud noises from either outdoor or indoor units. The symptoms mentioned include grinding, squealing, or rattling sounds. Possible causes are debris in the fan, worn fan motor bearings, and loose components.\n\nHmm, looking for entities of the specified types. Let's see:\n\n- Organizations: I don't see any organization names here.\n- Persons: No individuals mentioned either.\n- Geo locations: The text talks about outdoor and indoor units but doesn't specify a particular location like a city or country.\n- Events: There could be an event related to the AC issue, maybe \"AC Making Loud Noise\" as an event.\n- Categories: Maybe \"Technical Troubleshooting\" as it's about diagnosing and fixing problems.\n\nNow, identifying entities:\n\n1. Event: The main event seems to be the problem with the AC making noise. So, I can name this as \"AC Making Loud Noise\". It describes a specific incident where the AC unit is malfunctioning with loud noises.\n\n2. Categories: Since the text provides steps to diagnose and fix issues, it falls under \"Technical Troubleshooting\".\n\nNext, relationships between these entities. The event is clearly related to the troubleshooting category because the troubleshooting process addresses the event. They are directly connected as solving the event requires the troubleshooting steps outlined.\n\nFor content-level keywords, I should capture the main themes: technical troubleshooting, AC maintenance, and possible causes like debris or worn bearings.\n\nWait, but in the output, I need to format them correctly with the specified tags. Also, ensure that each entity is properly described, even if some types aren't present here. Since there are no organizations, persons, or specific geos mentioned, I can focus on the event and category.\n\nI think that's it. No other entities seem relevant in this context. The relationships are straightforward as they tie the event to its troubleshooting process.\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>\"AC Making Loud Noise\"<|>\"event\"<|>\"An event where an air conditioning unit produces grinding, squealing, or rattling noises from either the outdoor or indoor unit.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Technical Troubleshooting\"<|>\"category\"<|>\"A category related to diagnosing and resolving technical issues in air conditioning systems.\")##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"AC Making Loud Noise\"<|>\"Technical Troubleshooting\"<|>\"The AC making loud noise is being addressed through a series of technical troubleshooting steps to identify and resolve the root cause.\"<|>\"diagnostic process, problem-solving\"<|>8)##\n(\"content_keywords\"<|>\"technical troubleshooting, AC maintenance, equipment malfunction\")<|COMPLETE|>",

      "return": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to tackle this problem where I need to identify entities and their relationships based on the given text. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event, and category. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the provided text carefully. It seems like a technical document about AC unit issues, specifically three problems: not cooling, not turning on, and making loud noises. Each issue has symptoms and possible root causes with corresponding actions to fix them.\n\nStarting with Step 1, I need to identify all entities. Let's go through each section one by one.\n\nFor Issue 1: AC Unit is Not Cooling\n- Symptoms include the fan blowing but no cold air, outdoor unit not running, etc.\n- Possible root causes are Dirty Air Filter, Low Refrigerant, and Faulty Capacitor.\n- Each root cause has a sequence of actions to address it. \n\nSo here, I can identify \"Dirty Air Filter\" as an issue under category. Similarly, \"Low Refrigerant\" and \"Faulty Capacitor\" also fall under the category type since they are types of problems.\n\nFor Issue 2: AC Unit Will Not Turn On\n- Symptoms include thermostat not working, no sounds from units.\n- Root causes are No Power to Unit, Faulty Thermostat, Failed Transformer. Again, these are categories of issues.\n\nIssue 3: AC is Making a Loud Noise\n- Symptoms mention noises like grinding or squealing.\n- The root cause isn't specified in the provided text, but it's another category issue.\n\nNow, looking for other entities:\n- The text mentions \"AC Unit,\" which is an organization? Wait, no. Organizations would be companies or groups, so maybe not applicable here. Similarly, there are no person names mentioned, just technical terms.\n\n\"Geo\" refers to geographical locations, but the document doesn't specify any. Events are specific occurrences, but again, nothing stands out as an event in this context. So perhaps all entities fall under \"category.\"\n\nNext, Step 2 is identifying relationships between these entities. Since they're all categories related to AC issues, each root cause is connected to its respective issue.\n\nFor example:\n- \"Dirty Air Filter\" relates to the first issue about not cooling.\n- \"Low Refrigerant\" also ties into the same issue.\n- Similarly, other root causes are linked to their parent issues.\n\nStep 3 involves content keywords. The main themes here are AC unit problems, cooling issues, power-related problems, noise issues, and the categories of these issues.\n\nPutting it all together, I need to structure each entity with its name, type, and description. Then, outline the relationships between each root cause and its issue, explaining why they're connected, along with keywords and strength scores.\n\nI should ensure that the output follows the specified format, using \"##\" as delimiters and ending with \"<|COMPLETE|>\".\n</think>\n\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Dirty Air Filter\"<|>\"category\"<|>\"A category representing an issue where accumulated dirt on the air filter obstructs airflow, causing poor cooling performance.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Low Refrigerant\"<|>\"category\"<|>\"A category indicating insufficient refrigerant levels due to leaks or improper charging, leading to inadequate cooling.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Faulty Capacitor\"<|>\"category\"<|>\"A category describing a malfunction in the capacitor unit, affecting the AC's ability to start and maintain operation.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"No Power to Unit\"<|>\"category\"<|>\"A category denoting issues where electrical power isn't reaching the AC system, preventing it from turning on.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Faulty Thermostat\"<|>\"category\"<|>\"A category referring to problems with the thermostat's functionality, such as not sending signals to activate the AC unit.\")##\n(\"entity\"<|>\"Failed Transformer\"<|>\"category\"<|>\"A category indicating a malfunction in the transformer, which is crucial for providing power to various components of the AC system.\")##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Dirty Air Filter\"<|>\"AC Unit is Not Cooling\"<|>\"The presence of a dirty air filter can restrict airflow and reduce cooling efficiency, contributing to the issue where the AC unit fails to cool properly.\"<|>\"airflow obstruction, cooling inefficiency\"<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Low Refrigerant\"<|>\"AC Unit is Not Cooling\"<|>\"Insufficient refrigerant levels prevent the system from effectively absorbing and transferring heat, leading to inadequate cooling performance.\"<|>\"refrigeration cycle failure, heat transfer inefficiency\"<|>9)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Faulty Capacitor\"<|>\"AC Unit is Not Cooling\"<|>\"A faulty capacitor can disrupt the electrical circuit necessary for proper operation, potentially causing the AC unit to malfunction and fail to cool effectively.\"<|>\"electrical malfunction, system disruption\"<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"No Power to Unit\"<|>\"AC Unit Will Not Turn On\"<|>\"Lack of power supply prevents the AC unit from receiving electrical energy required for operation, resulting in the system not turning on.\"<|>\"power failure, electrical disconnect\"<|>10)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Faulty Thermostat\"<|>\"AC Unit Will Not Turn On\"<|>\"A faulty thermostat fails to send the necessary signals to activate the AC unit, preventing it from starting even when powered.\"|>\"control system malfunction, signal failure\"<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"Failed Transformer\"<|>\"AC Unit Will Not Turn On\"<|>\"Failure of the transformer means that the required electrical power is not being supplied to critical components, causing the AC unit to remain non-functional.\"<|>\"electrical supply interruption, component failure\"<|>9)##\n(\"content_keywords\"<|>\"AC issues, cooling problems, electrical failures, system malfunctions\")<|COMPLETE|>",

Power Disconnection: Turn off the circuit breaker dedicated to the AC unit.  2. Locate and Remove Filter: Open the indoor unit's front panel to access the air filter(s). Slide or unclip the filter to remove it.  3. Inspect Filter: Hold the filter up to a light source. If you cannot see light through it, it is dirty and needs cleaning or replacement.  4. Clean or Replace: If the filter is reusable, wash it with a mild detergent and water. Allow it to dry completely before reinstallation. If it is a disposable filter, replace it with a new one of the same specifications.  5. Reassemble and Test: Reinstall the filter, close the front panel, and restore power to the unit. Set the thermostat to a low temperature and check if the air is now cooling.\nLow Refrigerant\t1. Safety Precautions: Wear safety goggles and gloves. Refrigerant can cause frostbite.  2. Connect Gauges: Attach a refrigerant manifold gauge set to the service ports on the outdoor unit's suction and liquid lines.  3. Check Pressures: With the AC running, observe the pressure readings. Compare the readings to the manufacturer's specified pressures for the current indoor and outdoor temperatures. Significantly low pressure on the suction side is a strong indicator of a leak.  4. Leak Detection: If a leak is suspected, use an electronic leak detector or a soap bubble solution along the refrigerant lines and at connection points to pinpoint the leak.  5. Repair and Recharge: Once the leak is found, recover the remaining refrigerant, repair the leak (e.g., by brazing), and then evacuate the system to remove non-condensable gases. Finally, recharge the system with the correct type and amount of refrigerant as specified on the unit's nameplate.  6. Verify Operation: Run the AC and re-check the pressures to ensure they are within the specified range and that the unit is cooling effectively.\nFaulty Capacitor\t1. Power Disconnection: Ensure the power to the AC unit is off at the circuit breaker.  2. Locate Capacitor: Open the access panel on the outdoor unit to locate the capacitor(s). There may be separate start and run capacitors.  3. Visually Inspect: Look for signs of a failed capacitor, such as a bulging or leaking top.  4. Discharge Capacitor: CRITICAL STEP: Use an insulated screwdriver to short across the capacitor's terminals to discharge any stored electrical charge.  5. Test Capacitor: Disconnect the wires to the capacitor (noting their original positions). Set a multimeter to the capacitance setting and test the capacitor. The reading should be within the microfarad (µF) range specified on the capacitor's label. A reading of zero or significantly below the rated value indicates a faulty capacitor.  6. Replace Capacitor: If the capacitor is faulty, replace it with a new one with the same voltage and microfarad rating.  7. Reassemble and Test: Reconnect the wires, secure the access panel, restore power, and test the AC unit.\n\n\nIssue 2: AC Unit Will Not Turn On\n\nObserved Symptoms:\n\nThe thermostat is set to \"cool,\" but nothing happens.\nThere is no sound or activity from either the indoor or outdoor unit.\n\nPossible Root Cause\tSequence of Actions to Address the Root Cause:\n\nNo Power to Unit\t1. Check Thermostat: Ensure the thermostat is set to \"cool\" and the set temperature is below the current room temperature. Check if the thermostat display is on; if not, replace the batteries.  2. Check Circuit Breaker: Locate the electrical panel and check if the circuit breaker for the AC unit has tripped. If it has, reset it once. If it trips again, there is a more serious electrical issue that needs investigation.  3. Check Disconnect Switch: The outdoor unit has a nearby disconnect switch, usually in a metal box. Ensure this switch is in the \"on\" position.  4. Check Fuses: Some disconnect switches contain fuses. With the power off, pull out the disconnect block and test the fuses for continuity using a multimeter. Replace any blown fuses.\nFaulty Thermostat\t1. Bypass Thermostat: With the power off, at the thermostat, disconnect the wires from the R (or Rc) and Y terminals and twist them together. Restore power. If the AC unit turns on, the thermostat is faulty and needs to be replaced.  2. Replace Thermostat: If the thermostat is confirmed to be the issue, purchase a compatible replacement. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for wiring and installation.\nFailed Transformer\t1. Power Disconnection: Turn off power to the indoor air handler.  2. Locate Transformer: Open the access panel on the air handler to find the transformer.  3. Test Transformer: Use a multimeter to check the voltage on the primary (high voltage) and secondary (low voltage) sides of the transformer. If there is power on the primary side but not on the secondary side (typically 24V), the transformer has failed.  4. Replace Transformer: If the transformer is faulty, replace it with a new one with the same voltage ratings.\n\n\nIssue 3: AC is Making a Loud Noise\n\nObserved Symptoms:\n\nA grinding, squealing, or rattling noise is coming from\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nIssue 1: AC Unit is Not Cooling\\n\\nObserved Symptoms:\\n\\nThe fan is blowing air, but the air is not cold or is only slightly cool.\\nThe indoor unit is operating, but the outdoor unit (condenser) is not running.\\nThe unit runs continuously but never reaches the set temperature.\\n\\nPossible Root Cause\\tSequence of Actions to Address the Root Cause:\\n\\nDirty Air Filter\\t1. Power Disconnection: Turn off the circuit breaker dedicated to the AC unit.  2. Locate and Remove Filter: Open the indoor unit's front panel to access the air filter(s). Slide or unclip the filter to remove it.  3. Inspect Filter: Hold the filter up to a light source. If you cannot see light through it, it is dirty and needs cleaning or replacement.  4. Clean or Replace: If the filter is reusable, wash it with a mild detergent and water. Allow it to dry completely before reinstallation. If it is a disposable filter, replace it with a new one of the same specifications.  5. Reassemble and Test: Reinstall the filter, close the front panel, and restore power to the unit. Set the thermostat to a low temperature and check if the air is now cooling.\\nLow Refrigerant\\t1. Safety Precautions: Wear safety goggles and gloves. Refrigerant can cause frostbite.  2. Connect Gauges: Attach a refrigerant manifold gauge set to the service ports on the outdoor unit's suction and liquid lines.  3. Check Pressures: With the AC running, observe the pressure readings. Compare the readings to the manufacturer's specified pressures for the current indoor and outdoor temperatures. Significantly low pressure on the suction side is a strong indicator of a leak.  4. Leak Detection: If a leak is suspected, use an electronic leak detector or a soap bubble solution along the refrigerant lines and at connection points to pinpoint the leak.  5. Repair and Recharge: Once the leak is found, recover the remaining refrigerant, repair the leak (e.g., by brazing), and then evacuate the system to remove non-condensable gases. Finally, recharge the system with the correct type and amount of refrigerant as specified on the unit's nameplate.  6. Verify Operation: Run the AC and re-check the pressures to ensure they are within the specified range and that the unit is cooling effectively.\\nFaulty Capacitor\\t1. Power Disconnection: Ensure the power to the AC unit is off at the circuit breaker.  2. Locate Capacitor: Open the access panel on the outdoor unit to locate the capacitor(s). There may be separate start and run capacitors.  3. Visually Inspect: Look for signs of a failed capacitor, such as a bulging or leaking top.  4. Discharge Capacitor: CRITICAL STEP: Use an insulated screwdriver to short across the capacitor's terminals to discharge any stored electrical charge.  5. Test Capacitor: Disconnect the wires to the capacitor (noting their original positions). Set a multimeter to the capacitance setting and test the capacitor. The reading should be within the microfarad (µF) range specified on the capacitor's label. A reading of zero or significantly below the rated value indicates a faulty capacitor.  6. Replace Capacitor: If the capacitor is faulty, replace it with a new one with the same voltage and microfarad rating.  7. Reassemble and Test: Reconnect the wires, secure the access panel, restore power, and test the AC unit.\\n\\n\\nIssue 2: AC Unit Will Not Turn On\\n\\nObserved Symptoms:\\n\\nThe thermostat is set to \\\"cool,\\\" but nothing happens.\\nThere is no sound or activity from either the indoor or outdoor unit.\\n\\nPossible Root Cause\\tSequence of Actions to Address the Root Cause:\\n\\nNo Power to Unit\\t1. Check Thermostat: Ensure the thermostat is set to \\\"cool\\\" and the set temperature is below the current room temperature. Check if the thermostat display is on; if not, replace the batteries.  2. Check Circuit Breaker: Locate the electrical panel and check if the circuit breaker for the AC unit has tripped. If it has, reset it once. If it trips again, there is a more serious electrical issue that needs investigation.  3. Check Disconnect Switch: The outdoor unit has a nearby disconnect switch, usually in a metal box. Ensure this switch is in the \\\"on\\\" position.  4. Check Fuses: Some disconnect switches contain fuses. With the power off, pull out the disconnect block and test the fuses for continuity using a multimeter. Replace any blown fuses.\\nFaulty Thermostat\\t1. Bypass Thermostat: With the power off, at the thermostat, disconnect the wires from the R (or Rc) and Y terminals and twist them together. Restore power. If the AC unit turns on, the thermostat is faulty and needs to be replaced.  2. Replace Thermostat: If the thermostat is confirmed to be the issue, purchase a compatible replacement. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for wiring and installation.\\nFailed Transformer\\t1. Power Disconnection: Turn off power to the indoor air handler.  2. Locate Transformer: Open the access panel on the air handler to find the transformer.  3. Test Transformer: Use a multimeter to check the voltage on the primary (high voltage) and secondary (low voltage) sides of the transformer. If there is power on the primary side but not on the secondary side (typically 24V), the transformer has failed.  4. Replace Transformer: If the transformer is faulty, replace it with a new one with the same voltage ratings.\\n\\n\\nIssue 3: AC is Making a Loud Noise\\n\\nObserved Symptoms:\\n\\nA grinding, squealing, or rattling noise is coming from\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"<think>\\nAlright, I'm trying to tackle this problem where I need to identify entities and their relationships based on the given text. The entity types allowed are organization, person, geo, event, and category. Let's break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I'll read through the provided text carefully. It seems like a technical document about AC unit issues, specifically three problems: not cooling, not turning on, and making loud noises. Each issue has symptoms and possible root causes with corresponding actions to fix them.\\n\\nStarting with Step 1, I need to identify all entities. Let's go through each section one by one.\\n\\nFor Issue 1: AC Unit is Not Cooling\\n- Symptoms include the fan blowing but no cold air, outdoor unit not running, etc.\\n- Possible root causes are Dirty Air Filter, Low Refrigerant, and Faulty Capacitor.\\n- Each root cause has a sequence of actions to address it. \\n\\nSo here, I can identify \\\"Dirty Air Filter\\\" as an issue under category. Similarly, \\\"Low Refrigerant\\\" and \\\"Faulty Capacitor\\\" also fall under the category type since they are types of problems.\\n\\nFor Issue 2: AC Unit Will Not Turn On\\n- Symptoms include thermostat not working, no sounds from units.\\n- Root causes are No Power to Unit, Faulty Thermostat, Failed Transformer. Again, these are categories of issues.\\n\\nIssue 3: AC is Making a Loud Noise\\n- Symptoms mention noises like grinding or squealing.\\n- The root cause isn't specified in the provided text, but it's another category issue.\\n\\nNow, looking for other entities:\\n- The text mentions \\\"AC Unit,\\\" which is an organization? Wait, no. Organizations would be companies or groups, so maybe not applicable here. Similarly, there are no person names mentioned, just technical terms.\\n\\n\\\"Geo\\\" refers to geographical locations, but the document doesn't specify any. Events are specific occurrences, but again, nothing stands out as an event in this context. So perhaps all entities fall under \\\"category.\\\"\\n\\nNext, Step 2 is identifying relationships between these entities. Since they're all categories related to AC issues, each root cause is connected to its respective issue.\\n\\nFor example:\\n- \\\"Dirty Air Filter\\\" relates to the first issue about not cooling.\\n- \\\"Low Refrigerant\\\" also ties into the same issue.\\n- Similarly, other root causes are linked to their parent issues.\\n\\nStep 3 involves content keywords. The main themes here are AC unit problems, cooling issues, power-related problems, noise issues, and the categories of these issues.\\n\\nPutting it all together, I need to structure each entity with its name, type, and description. Then, outline the relationships between each root cause and its issue, explaining why they're connected, along with keywords and strength scores.\\n\\nI should ensure that the output follows the specified format, using \\\"##\\\" as delimiters and ending with \\\"<|COMPLETE|>\\\".\\n</think>\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Dirty Air Filter\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"A category representing an issue where accumulated dirt on the air filter obstructs airflow, causing poor cooling performance.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Low Refrigerant\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"A category indicating insufficient refrigerant levels due to leaks or improper charging, leading to inadequate cooling.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Faulty Capacitor\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"A category describing a malfunction in the capacitor unit, affecting the AC's ability to start and maintain operation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"No Power to Unit\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"A category denoting issues where electrical power isn't reaching the AC system, preventing it from turning on.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Faulty Thermostat\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"A category referring to problems with the thermostat's functionality, such as not sending signals to activate the AC unit.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Failed Transformer\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"A category indicating a malfunction in the transformer, which is crucial for providing power to various components of the AC system.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Dirty Air Filter\\\"<|>\\\"AC Unit is Not Cooling\\\"<|>\\\"The presence of a dirty air filter can restrict airflow and reduce cooling efficiency, contributing to the issue where the AC unit fails to cool properly.\\\"<|>\\\"airflow obstruction, cooling inefficiency\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Low Refrigerant\\\"<|>\\\"AC Unit is Not Cooling\\\"<|>\\\"Insufficient refrigerant levels prevent the system from effectively absorbing and transferring heat, leading to inadequate cooling performance.\\\"<|>\\\"refrigeration cycle failure, heat transfer inefficiency\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Faulty Capacitor\\\"<|>\\\"AC Unit is Not Cooling\\\"<|>\\\"A faulty capacitor can disrupt the electrical circuit necessary for proper operation, potentially causing the AC unit to malfunction and fail to cool effectively.\\\"<|>\\\"electrical malfunction, system disruption\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"No Power to Unit\\\"<|>\\\"AC Unit Will Not Turn On\\\"<|>\\\"Lack of power supply prevents the AC unit from receiving electrical energy required for operation, resulting in the system not turning on.\\\"<|>\\\"power failure, electrical disconnect\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Faulty Thermostat\\\"<|>\\\"AC Unit Will Not Turn On\\\"<|>\\\"A faulty thermostat fails to send the necessary signals to activate the AC unit, preventing it from starting even when powered.\\\"|>\\\"control system malfunction, signal failure\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Failed Transformer\\\"<|>\\\"AC Unit Will Not Turn On\\\"<|>\\\"Failure of the transformer means that the required electrical power is not being supplied to critical components, causing the AC unit to remain non-functional.\\\"<|>\\\"electrical supply interruption, component failure\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"AC issues, cooling problems, electrical failures, system malfunctions\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.\nFormat the content-level key words as (\"content_keywords\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n5. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n---Output---\n\nAdd them below using the same format:"
