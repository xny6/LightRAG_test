Actual battery life may vary depending on volume, frequency, output source, environmental interference, product features used, and usage habits. Actual experience will depend on individual use.\nWhat is the Smart ANC Algorithm?\tThe Smart ANC algorithm automatically detects the current wearing status and external noise leakage through the earphones' in-ear detection whenever the earphones are in ANC ON mode. After detection, the earphones will automatically generate corresponding noise reduction parameters to optimize the current noise cancellation effect, providing the best noise cancellation experience for the user. This entire process runs automatically without user intervention.\n\nThe algorithm operates under specific conditions; if the conditions are not met, the algorithm will not be triggered and will default to running with fixed strong noise reduction parameters. This ensures that the basic noise cancellation experience remains unaffected, so you can use it with confidence.\n\nFor the algorithm to function correctly, please ensure the following conditions are met during wear:\n1. The default noise cancellation state after wearing needs to be ANC ON: You can switch to ANC ON state through the app or pressure-sensitive controls after wearing, then remove and re-wear the earphones to trigger the in-ear detection and the Smart ANC algorithm.\n2. To achieve noticeable noise cancellation improvement, ensure the ambient noise level is >65dB when triggering the detection.\n3. Avoid swallowing movements during the detection process.\n\nIf you notice a difference in noise cancellation, you can remove and re-wear the earphones under the above conditions to trigger the algorithm detection.\nCan the charging case still charge the earbuds when it is low on battery?\tYes, the charging case can still charge the earbuds when the battery is below 30% but above 1%.

When the charging case is opened, the earphones will automatically power on and reconnect. 1.1 If you have less than two devices connected and the Buds are powered on, they will auto-reconnect in the state of dual connectivity. The reconnect targets the last two connected devices. If it's the first time the earphones are enabling dual connectivity and there are no previous reconnect records, the earphones will stay in single-device connection mode (no pairing occurs and the pairing process for new devices needs to be manually triggered by the user holding down the button). If the earphones fail to reconnect to other devices, they will remain in single-device connection mode (no pairing). 1.2. If the earphones are out of range, auto-reconnection will only work for the phone that was out of range. 1.3. Auto-reconnection will not be triggered when the earphones are in an active state (during a call or music playback). 1.4. If the earphones are in the process of auto-reconnection and in an active state (during a call or music playback), the earphones will pause the auto-reconnect for 5 seconds. If the active state is exited within the reconnect timeout, the earphones will resume the paused auto-reconnect until the reconnect timeout is reached (calculated from the first auto-reconnect trigger). 2. Connection priority (connection snatch): When in dual-connectivity mode, the earphones can be snatched by another device and the following applies: 2.1. When neither of the two connected phones is in music playback state, the earphones will disconnect from the initially connected phone and connect to the device initiating the connection snatch. 2.2. When the earphones enter pairing mode with a new device, and if they are currently connected to two devices, the earphones will disconnect from one of the connected devices during the pairing process. After one of the devices has been disconnected, it becomes discoverable and can be connected to the new device. 2.3 If the earphones are currently connected to two devices, and a third device with a connection record initiates a connection snatch, the earphones will disconnect from one of the connected devices. After disconnecting from one device, it can be snatched by the third device initiating the connection snatch. Note: 1. Music playback: 1.1 If one of the two connected phones is in the music playback state, the earphones will disconnect from the phone not in the music playback state and then connect to the device initiating the connection snatch. 1.2 If both phones are in the music playback state, the earphones will disconnect from the phone that is not producing sound (i.e. the device in a muted music playback state) and connect to the device initiating the connection snatch. 2. Call State: 2.1 If any of the two connected phones is in a call state, connection snatching will not occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I use gestures to control functions?\tThe Buds Pro earbuds use touch to trigger control of functions.

Auto-reconnection will not be triggered when the earphones are in an active state (during a call or music playback). 1.4. If the earphones are in the process of auto-reconnection and in an active state (during a call or music playback), the earphones will pause the auto-reconnect for 5 seconds. If the active state is exited within the reconnect timeout, the earphones will resume the paused auto-reconnect until the reconnect timeout is reached (calculated from the first auto-reconnect trigger). 2. Connection priority (connection snatch): When in dual-connectivity mode, the earphones can be snatched by another device and the following applies: 2.1. When neither of the two connected phones is in music playback state, the earphones will disconnect from the initially connected phone and connect to the device initiating the connection snatch. 2.2. When the earphones enter pairing mode with a new device, and if they are currently connected to two devices, the earphones will disconnect from one of the connected devices during the pairing process. After one of the devices has been disconnected, it becomes discoverable and can be connected to the new device. 2.3 If the earphones are currently connected to two devices, and a third device with a connection record initiates a connection snatch, the earphones will disconnect from one of the connected devices. After disconnecting from one device, it can be snatched by the third device initiating the connection snatch. Note: 1. Music playback: 1.1 If one of the two connected phones is in the music playback state, the earphones will disconnect from the phone not in the music playback state and then connect to the device initiating the connection snatch. 1.2 If both phones are in the music playback state, the earphones will disconnect from the phone that is not producing sound (i.e. the device in a muted music playback state) and connect to the device initiating the connection snatch. 2. Call State: 2.1 If any of the two connected phones is in a call state, connection snatching will not occur.\nHow do I reset the Neckband Pro?\tAfter separating the left and right earbuds, simultaneously press and hold the Smart Dial and function button for 5 seconds.

For more features, please connect to the CMF Watch app for a complete experience.\nWhat is the Active Score?\tWhat Is Active Score? \nActive Score, is a health metric that quantifies physical activity using heart rate data. It is calculated from your heart's response to exercise over a rolling 7-day period. This metric helps you gauge the intensity and effectiveness of your workouts. Aim for an Active Score of 100 each week to maintain good health.\n\nImportantly, any amount of physical activity is better than none. Incremental increases in physical activity, even at low intensities, can contribute to health improvements by reducing sedentary time.\n\nHow Is It Calculated? \nThe Active Score is tailored to individual profiles, including factors like age, resting heart rate, maximum heart rate, and recent exercise history over the last 7 days.\nBy performing physical activities while monitored by your smartwatch, you accumulate Active scores. Activities of higher intensity will generate more scores in less time, enhancing your score more efficiently.\nAs your Active Score grows, acquiring additional points becomes progressively challenging.\n\nWhy Is It Calculated On A 7-Day Basis? \nThe Active Score offers a snapshot of your physical activity impact over a rolling 7-day period. This flexible system allows you to spread your activity throughout the week without the pressure of achieving a high level of exercise every single day. Accumulating scores is possible anytime within this period, although we recommend engaging in physical activities 2-3 times a week to optimize both your physical and mental well-being.\nWhat is Training Load?\tTraining Load is an estimate of the physical stress exerted on your body during and after a workout, based on parameters such as training time, distance, and intensity. This metric directly relates to your body's fatigue level. \n\nAfter each workout, the Training Load can be calculated using the duration and heart rate of the exercise. By tracking the daily Training Load over seven days, you can observe fluctuations in your weekly Training Load curve.\n\nFollowing a workout, physical fitness initially decreases but gradually increases with proper diet and sleep, often surpassing the original fitness level—a phenomenon known as supercompensation. To improve fitness, it's crucial to balance training and rest; continuous overloading can lead to suboptimal results.\n\nAerobic Training Effect (ATE) Ratings:\n<1.0: Light activity or warm-up\n1.0-1.9: Relaxed state (low intensity, helps in relaxation and recovery)\n2.0-2.9: Basic training (maintains basic aerobic fitness)\n3.0-3.9: Effective training (gradually enhances fitness)\n4.0-4.9: Intensive training (promotes significant fitness improvement)\n5.0: Extreme challenge (high-risk, requires full recovery)\n\nAnaerobic Training Effect (AnTE) Ratings:\n<1.0: Light activity or warm-up\n1.0-1.9: Light activation (awakens muscles with light intensity)\n2.0-2.9: Maintenance level (maintains current muscle status)\n3.0-3.9: Moderate improvement (enhances muscle strength)\n4.0-4.9: Significant enhancement (promotes substantial fitness improvement)\n5.0: Extreme challenge (high-risk, requires full recovery)\nWhat is Recovery Time?\tRecovery Time indicates the duration required for you to fully recover your fitness before engaging in the next intense workout.\nThe recovery time is displayed immediately after each exercise session and counts down to help you evaluate when you are ready for high-intensity training again. This feature aids in planning your training schedule effectively. If you work out before fully recovering, the recovery time will accumulate.\nWhat is WorkOut Detection?\t1.

If so, replace it. \n\nNote that each adaptor has undergone rigorous safety certification and testing. The sparks do not affect product use or pose any safety risks.\nWhy does the charging port stop working and restart when I start using another port?\tThe adaptor will allocate power when multiple ports are in use. During this power distribution process, there may be a brief interruption before the charging resumes. Please refer to the user manual for more details.\nI'm charging my laptop via the USB-C port and my phone via the USB-A port. Why does the charging via the USB-C port get interrupted for a moment?\tIf the charging current from the USB-A port is less than 0.1A, the USB-C port automatically adjusts power distribution. If the charging current from the USB-A port is greater than 1.0A, the USB-C port automatically adjusts power distribution.\nWhy do I feel tingling or an electric shock sensation when I touch the wire terminals?\tFor electrical safety, the adaptor has a grounding design, so the presence of leakage current is normal. This leakage current is within standard limits and does not harm human health.\nOne port is charging and the other one is plugged in. Why does the charging port that I used first stop charging?\tWhen using a single USB-C port, charging can reach up to 100W. However, when multiple ports are used simultaneously, the power is redistributed, causing the charging power to be reduced. This may result in some high-power devices being unable to continue charging. For high-power devices, we recommend using a single port.\n\nPlease refer to the instruction manual included to understand the power parameters for multi-port use.\nWhy does the adaptor feel hot when charging?\tTo resolve the issue, try the below: \n\n1. Ensure that the device(s) you're charging don't require more than 140W. If the device's original charger is rated above 140W or if the charger is used continuously for multi-port charging, the adaptor may operate at full power for extended periods, which can cause it to heat up.\n2. The adaptor converts alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC). During this process, there is energy conversion and loss. The lost energy is released in the form of heat. The adaptor also contains electronic components such as inductors and capacitors. When current flows through these components, they generate resistance, converting some of the electrical energy into heat. This is why the adaptor feels hot.\n\nFor your safety, please charge your device in a cool and well ventilated environment. If you find that the product is overheating, please stop using it immediately and contact us.\nWhy does the adaptor charge so slowly?\tTo resolve the issue, try the below: \n\n1) Ensure that the fast charging protocol of your device is compatible with the adaptor. The charging power of different charging protocols can vary, and some devices may use proprietary charging protocols.\n2) Ensure that the USB cable is properly connected and that the USB cable isn't damaged. If the connection is unstable, charging may be intermittent.\n3) Ensure that the charging ports of the device and the charging cable are free from dirt and damage that may cause intermittent charging.\n4) If the temperature of the device being charged is too high, the charging speed may be limited. You can try to unplug the device for a short period of time or place it in a cooler environment and then reconnect the adaptor.\n5) If using multiple ports simultaneously, the charging power for each individual port is reduced. For instance, the maximum power for the USB A port is 10W when all three charging ports are being used. To achieve higher charging power, disconnect devices that are already fully charged.\n\nIf the issue remains unresolved, we recommend taking your device to a service center for inspection.\nWhy won't the adaptor charge other devices?\tTo resolve the issue, try the below: \n\n1) Ensure that the voltage in the region you are using the adaptor is compatible with the working voltage of the adaptor.\n2) Ensure that the output voltage of the adaptor is compatible with the device's required working voltage.\n3) Ensure that the adaptor interface is compatible with the charging cable interface.\n4) Ensure that the USB cable is properly connected and that the USB cable is not damaged.\n5) Try using another adaptor to check if the problem is to do with the battery. \n6) Ensure that the charging ports of the device and the charging cable are free from dirt and damage.\n7) Ensure that the adaptor is compatible with your device's fast charging protocol.

It supports 24 bit/192 kHz high-resolution audio streaming transmission. The transmission rate can reach up to 1 Mbps, which is about 4 times that of the traditional SBC encoder (328Kbps). The high-resolution audio file will not be over-compressed, so more music details can be retained, and the sound quality will be significantly improved.\n*High-quality audio settings need to be supported by the phone and the selected codec must be enabled on the phone to take effect.\n\nFor Nothing phones, the LHDC Bluetooth audio codec function is turned on by default. After the user connects the headset using Nothing OS, LHDC high-quality Bluetooth audio transmission is enabled by default. Users can operate the headset in the Nothing X app to turn on or off LHDC audio encoding.\nFor non-Nothing Android phones, you can check whether the phone supports LHDC in the Bluetooth Audio Codec settings of the phone. If the phone supports it, turn on the phone's LHDC in the settings and confirm that LHDC is checked in the HD encoding options of the Nothing X app. LHDC high-quality Bluetooth audio transmission will be turned on.\n*To ensure smooth playback of LHDC high-definition audio, it is recommended to turn off the Dual Connection function when using this function to ensure sufficient bandwidth for the LHDC high-definition stream.\n*Since iOS devices only support the AAC Bluetooth codec, other high-quality audio codecs are not currently supported.\nHow to use the LDAC feature?\tLDAC high-definition audio can be likened to a \"highway\" between the phone and headphones, supporting streaming rates of 990kbps and a sample rate of 96kHz with a bit depth of 24-bit.

If not, go to [Settings – Developer Options] to see if LDAC is supported. If your phone supports it, activate the phone's LDAC and make sure high-definition encoding is turned on in the Nothing X app, thus enabling LDAC high-definition audio encodinг.\n*To ensure smooth playback of LDAC high-definition audio, it is recommended that when using this feature, 1) the default LDAC playback quality in the developer options is set to adaptive; 2) if the phone chooses a higher quality audio stream, it is advised to turn off dual connection functionality to ensure there is enough bandwidth for the LDAC high-definition stream.\n*Since iOS devices only support the AAC Bluetooth high", "full_doc_id": "doc-89e588cf573b67bf191cb19e8aa70158", "file_path": "unknown_source"}, {"__id__": "chunk-8c10ba86f3c652add8c1d23db1a9625b", "__created_at__": 1749530981, "content": "X app, thus enabling LDAC high-definition audio encodinг.\n*To ensure smooth playback of LDAC high-definition audio, it is recommended that when using this feature, 1) the default LDAC playback quality in the developer options is set to adaptive; 2) if the phone chooses a higher quality audio stream, it is advised to turn off dual connection functionality to ensure there is enough bandwidth for the LDAC high-definition stream.\n*Since iOS devices only support the AAC Bluetooth high-quality audio codec, for the time being, they cannot support other high-quality audio codecs.\nHow do I set up a Personal Sound Profile?\t1.

Choose thin and breathable phone cases rather than heavy ones (leather or metal cases).\n- Choose a qualified phone radiator with good heat dissipation and cooling performance, or use a wet tissue to put on the back of the mobile phone to help dissipate heat.\n\nHeating usage scenario:\n1. High-power consumption scenarios\na) The signal is weak\nWhen the WiFi signal and SIM signal are weak, the device will increase the power of transmitting and receiving signals (currently, 5G base station coverage is incomplete, and the network signal is poor in some areas, resulting in increased power consumption and heat generation of mobile phones when using 5G).\nb) Play games\nTo ensure game image quality and smoothness, phone CPU, GPU and other chips need to operate at high performance. The network needs to communicate with the game server in real time. In addition, the screen and speakers work at the same time. The device is running with a high load, and the temperature of the phone will rise accordingly (generally reaches maximum temperature after 20 minutes).\nc) Watch videos\nThe phone screen, data processor and image processor are in a long-term working state. For example, when playing videos or live broadcasts, high-resolution and streaming comments will increase power consumption and generate more heat.\nd) Many backgrounds\nIf there are too many apps running in the background, or if the phone has WiFi, GPS, NFC, Bluetooth and other functions searching for signals or networks in the background, it will easily become overheated.\n\n2. When charging your mobile phone:\nCharging is an energy conversion process. The charging equipment generates a certain amount of heat during operation, causing both the phone and the charger to heat up. This is normal. Phones that support fast charging generate more heat during charging.\n\nSuggestion:\na) Be sure to use the official charger. Don't place the phone in a high-temperature environment with poor heat dissipation when charging.\nb) Avoid playing with your phone while charging. If the phone continues to run during charging, it will increase the load on the phone's CPU and increase heat.\n\nNote:\n- The phone needs hardware to cooperate during operation. When working, it will inevitably generate heat.\n- If the phone heats up inexplicably, turn it off for some time and restart it. If the issue persists, contact our Customer Service or go to the repair center designated by Nothing for testing with your purchase invoice, warranty card and phone.\nThe battery has dropped quickly.
